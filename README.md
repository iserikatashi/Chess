# ♟ Chess Web Application

A chess web application built using **vanilla JavaScript**, designed with a strong focus on **clean architecture**, **separation of concerns**, and **long-term scalability**.

This project is currently in an **early development stage**, but it is planned as a **full-featured public platform** combining frontend, backend, and server-side AI.

---

## 📌 Current Status

- ✅ Chess board rendering
- ✅ Initial board setup
- ✅ Clean architectural separation (engine / UI)
- ❌ Full move logic & rules (in progress / postponed)
- ❌ Backend & multiplayer (planned)
- ❌ AI engine (planned)

The current version focuses only on laying a **strong structural foundation**.

---

## 🌍 Public Repository Philosophy

This project is developed as a **fully public repository**.

- Frontend code will remain public
- Backend code will also be public
- Server-side AI logic will be public
- No closed-source core components are planned

The goal is **transparency, learning, and long-term maintainability**, not quick delivery.

---

## 🧠 Architecture Philosophy

- **Engine**
  - Handles game rules and calculations
  - Pure logic (no DOM, no UI)
  - Designed to support AI and server-side execution

- **UI**
  - Rendering and visual feedback
  - Board updates and move highlights
  - No game rule logic

- **Backend (Planned)**
  - Game sessions
  - Player matchmaking
  - Authentication
  - AI move computation

This separation is intentional and required to support online play and AI integration.

---

## 🚧 Planned Features (Future Updates)

- Complete chess move logic
- Legal move validation
- Move history & undo system
- User authentication (login / accounts)
- Online multiplayer (player vs player)
- Server-side chess AI (self-developed)
- Public AI logic & evaluation
- Persistent game storage

All advanced features will be introduced **incrementally**, not rushed.

---

## 🤖 AI Development Plan

- The chess AI will be:
  - Developed manually (no external chess engines)
  - Executed on the server side
  - Fully public and inspectable
- Focus will be on:
  - Correctness
  - Performance
  - Clean decision-making logic

AI development is intentionally postponed until the core game logic is stable.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project is part of a **long-term development journey**.

The goal is to build:
- a real web application
- with real users
- real backend logic
- and real architectural discipline

This is **not a demo project** and **not a quick clone**.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES Modules)
- Git & GitHub

Backend technologies will be introduced in later stages.

---

## 📅 Roadmap (High-Level)

1. Solidify frontend architecture
2. Build production-grade web applications
3. Introduce backend services
4. Implement authentication & multiplayer
5. Develop and integrate server-side AI

Each phase will be versioned and documented.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is **not finished** and **not production-ready**.

Features mentioned above are part of a **long-term plan**, not immediate guarantees.
