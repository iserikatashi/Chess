# ♟ Chess Web Application

A simple chess web application built using **vanilla JavaScript**, designed with a strong focus on **clean architecture** and **separation of concerns**.

This project is currently in an **early development stage**.  
The foundation is being prepared for a **larger future update**, including a backend server and advanced game logic.

---

## 📌 Current Status

- ✅ Chess board rendering
- ✅ Initial board setup
- ✅ Clean architectural separation (engine / UI)
- ❌ Move logic & game rules (not implemented yet)
- ❌ AI opponent
- ❌ Backend / multiplayer support

This repository currently serves as:
- A progress tracker
- A codebase foundation
- Preparation for future expansion

---

## 🧠 Architecture Philosophy

- **Engine**
  - Handles game data and rules
  - Contains pure logic only
  - No DOM or UI dependency

- **UI**
  - Responsible for rendering
  - Visual updates and highlights
  - User interaction feedback

- **Main / Controller**
  - Application initialization
  - Coordinates engine and UI
  - Manages overall game flow

This separation is intentional and required for long-term maintainability.

---

## 🚧 Planned Features (Future Update)

- Complete chess move logic
- Legal move validation
- Move history & undo system
- AI opponent
- Backend server
- Online multiplayer
- User accounts

These features are **intentionally postponed** to avoid premature complexity.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project is part of a **long-term learning and development process**.

The goal is not a quick demo, but a:
- scalable
- maintainable
- well-structured web application

Chess engine development is complex and will be revisited later with stronger preparation.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES Modules)
- Git & GitHub

No frameworks.  
No shortcuts.

---

## 📅 Roadmap

- Stabilize frontend architecture
- Build real-world web applications
- Return to this project with:
  - stronger architectural discipline
  - backend integration
  - advanced game features

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is **not finished** and **not ready for production use**.

If you are looking for a complete chess engine, this repository does **not** provide one — **yet**.
